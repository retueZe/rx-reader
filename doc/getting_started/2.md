# `IIoBuffer`

This interface is used to gather data the observables produce into 1 place, to have an opportunity to fetch it on demand.

Under the hood, it is a FIFO linked list of pushed chunks. It implements the `Observer` interface, so, it can be easily added into an existing pipeline.

```javascript
// have to specify the type of buffer ('text' and 'binary' are currently
// supported)
const buffer = new IoBuffer('text')

const observable = of('one', 'two', 'three')
// observable.subscribe(buffer) // <-- implicit `complete` subscription
// comletion of the `observable` will also cause a completion of the `buffer`,
// so, this is the case if you'd like to complete the `buffer` after the
// `observable` completion, or have a race between them
buffer.consume(observable)
// the code line above is more common and explicit, because it subscribes only
// the `next` callback, passing `error` and `complete` by.

// once we buffered all the data out, we achieved lossless backpressure and
// now we can pull the data
const data1 = buffer.read(5) // gets the data and removes it from the buffer
console.log(data1) // 'onetw'

const data2 = buffer.peek() // gets the data and retains it in the buffer
console.log(data2) // 'othree'

// removes given amount of items and returns the number of removed ones
buffer.skip(1)

const data3 = buffer.read(4)
console.log(data3) // 'thre'

```

Some useful properties of the `IIoBuffer` interface:

- `isCompleted` — indicates whether or not the buffer is completed (`error` or `complete` methods have been executed);
- `chunkTypeId` — can be either `'text'` or `'binary'`, representing the type of stored data;
- `isBinary` — `buffer.chunkTypeId === 'binary'`;
- `available` — returns the amount of buffered data items (i.e. characters or bytes, depending on buffer type);
- `isEmpty` — indicates whether the buffer is empty (`buffer.available < 0.5` because JS does have integers);
- `push` — duplicates `next`, `error`, and `complete` calls on the event's subscribers.

Reading of `IIoBuffer` may be done through reading whole chunks (chunk-pull) or by reading requried amount of data (view-pull). Chunk-pull methods:

- `first(): Option<ChunkTypeMap[C]>` — gets the first chunk in the queue, but does not remove it; if the buffer is empty, returns `NONE`;
- `shift(): Option<ChunkTypeMap[C]>` — acts as `first`, but actually removes the gotten chunk, if it's presented.

View-pull methods:

- `read(count?: number | null): ChunkTypeMap[C]` — reads given amount of items; it `count`'s type is not `number`, then reads all the available data; `count` acts here as a limit, not as a requirement, meaning that if you passed `5`, but there are only `3` items in the buffer, then only 3 items will be read;
- `peek(count?: number | null): ChunkTypeMap[C]` — acts as `read`, but retains the read data
- `skip(count?: number | null): number` — acts as `read`, but returns only the length of the read data, not the data

This API is a base of more advanced techniques.
